<desc>Amato has to study for his exams but is interrupted by a loud and terrible singing at night. The owner of the terrible voice is a bad robot named Karok, who was thrown into Space Prison for singing inside the Space Library. The singing gets worse every night, and starts to affect Amatos sleep and his studies. He has to stop Karok before the bad robot causes him to fail his exams. Using a staged rap battle between Pian and Deep to lure Karok out, Amato and friends finally defeat it with a combination of Amatos silat dancing and Maras poetry. After Karok surrenders, the kids discover that a broken voice box was behind Karoks terrible singing voice. Pian fixes it, to Karoks joy and everyone elses relief.</desc>
